## General Notes
Changes suggested in call 1:
1. See bank anchors and if possible, use their tethered assets for INVTokens instead of doing one ourselves (docs/anchors.md)
2. Split the PBToken idea into its own model and develop a model without the payback token in question
3. Add new entities - developers, contractors,  originators and provisions for them to do their assigned roles and duties.
4. Assume two models overall -
 - All banks are anchors on stellar - we can trade in tethered assets and will not face a problem technically
 - Banks involved with entities are not anchors and we need to come up with solutions to accommodate them in our model
5. Separate the role of an issuer and a platform. An issuer would be someone like neighbourly or swytch whereas the platform is something that we'd be developing upon

Observations:
 - Might be difficult to get banks as anchors since there seem to be only 4 popular ones around
